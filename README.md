# Continuous Integration Build Optimization

This repository has been created in order to optimize continuous integration builds. We concentrate on code coverage files that are generated during continuous integration and then deleted without being saved anywhere. For the time being, we are solely focusing on open-source Java Maven projects and GitHub Actions. The main.py script contains four parts and is designed to automate the entire procedure.

## Phases
#### Phase 1: Collection
After forking the specified project, we parse the __yaml__ files under the ```.github/workflows/``` folder and make various modifications on it to map the records in the _inotifywait_ logs to the steps in the __yaml__ file.
#### Phase 2: Setup
In the second phase, we prepare the runner for usage, as well as the environment in which the runner and _inotifywait_ will be utilized.
#### Phase 3: Execution
We trigger the runner that has been prepared by committing the updated __yaml__ files to the project forked in the third phase, and then we collect the logs created by _inotifywait_.
#### Phase 4: Analysis
The fourth and final phase involves analyzing the csv log generated by _inotifywait_ and identifying and reporting the time-consuming steps in __yaml__ files.
